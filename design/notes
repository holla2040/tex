22 lights total:
1) Landing (2 lights: Forward landing gear doors)
2) Cross Wind (1 light: Right forward landing gear door)
3) Taxi (1: Right forward landing gear, 1: Left tip gear door, 1: Right tip beer door)
4) In Flight Refueling (2: Left slipway, 2: Right slipway, 1 Refueling receptacle)
5) Terrain (1: Forward lower fuselage)
6) Anti-Collision (2: Upper fuselage left & right - rotating , 1: Lower fuselage - rotating)
7) Navigation (2: Wing tips, 2: Tail white and yellow, 3: Three mid-body (color?))

Relay 1: Terrain motor up
Relay 2: Terrain motor down


Or if wanted all anti-collision to be out of sync:
1) Landing (2: Forward landing gear doors)
   Cross Wind (1: Right forward landing gear door)
   Taxi (1: Right forward landing gear, 1: Left tip gear door, 1: Right tip beer door)
2) In Flight Refueling (2: Left slipway, 2: Right slipway, 1 Refueling receptacle)
3) Terrain (1: Forward lower fuselage)
4) Anti-Collision (1: Upper fuselage left - rotating
5) Anti-Collision (1: Upper fuselage right - rotating
6) Anti-Collision (1: Lower fuselage - rotating)
7) Navigation (2: Wing tips, 2: Tail white and yellow, 3: Three mid-body (color?))

Relay 1: Terrain motor up
Relay 2: Terrain motor down

OR, fewer channel option (could also use current Arduino board):
1) Landing, Crosswind, Taxi
2) In Flight Refueling
3) Terrain
4) Anti-Collision (variable)
5) Navigation     (variable)

Channel 6 or Relay 1: Terrain motor up
Channel 7 or Relay 2: Terrain motor down

--- Current F-16 ---

Current and New Board:
